<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Lisa and I am learning to be a Web Developer.  I am quite new to this and I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript to enable me to create a website.</p>

<p>I would then like to go on to learn more coding and developing to enable me to become a proficient front-end developer.

<p>If I succeed at that I would then like to continue with learning how to code to be come a back-end developer too which would eventually mean I was able to do full-stack developing.</p>
